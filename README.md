### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: The similar words and different sentiment changes of Presidents inaugural speech
+ This project is conducted by [Shuyao Hao]

+ Project summary: This project used mining text model and sentiment analysis to find similarities and differences sentiment over six latest presidents. The top 10 common words of each president are founded to show the main topics of them. Further, I calculated the frequency for each word across the entire six president speeches versus within each one
of them. This will allow us to compare strong deviations of word frequency within each speech as compared
to across the entire version. Finally, conducted the sentiment analysis to see the emotional changes of each president.
