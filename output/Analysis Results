Common Words
Words are close to the line such as “crucial”, “americas”, in these plots have similar frequencies across all the
novels.
Words that are far from the line are words that are found more in one text than another. Furthermore, words
standing out above the line are common across the entire speeches but not within a specfic one; whereas
words below the line are common in that specific speech but not in all the speeches.
For example, “Freedom” stands out above the line in the Donald J. Trump. This means that “Freedom” is
fairly common across the entire speeches but is not used as much in Trump’s inaugural speech.

Sentiment
From above plots we can see that all the speeched move more positive than nagetive and Trump seemed
to have a highest propotion of negative words. Also we can see clearly how the emotion of each president
changed over their inaugural speach.
